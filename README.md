### The Cancellation Conundrum: A Data Driven Solution for Hotel Businesses

The hotel industry is a vital component of the global economy, with revenues reaching over 550 billion dollars in 2022. However, with the increasing competition and changing customer preferences, it has become crucial for hotel businesses to optimize their operations and improve their profitability. One of the key metrics that hotel businesses need to focus on is booking cancellations.

Cancellations can have a significant impact on a hotel's bottom line, as it leads to lost revenue and unoccupied rooms. According to a study, the average hotel loses around $100 per room per night due to cancellations. This is where predictive analytics comes into play. By being able to predict the likelihood of a guest cancelling their booking, hotel businesses can take proactive measures to reduce these losses.

By using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and data visualization tools, this project is able to analyze a hotel booking dataset and identify the characteristics that are highly predictive of booking cancellations. By understanding these patterns, hotel businesses can improve their accuracy of predicting cancellations, and implement effective strategies to reduce losses caused by recurring cancellations.

The project also demonstrates that certain factors such as the type of hotel, lead time, arrival month, and deposit type play a crucial role in determining the cancellation rate. The results of this project can be used to inform business decisions and improve overall profitability.<br><br>

Some interesting insights that we got from our analysis include:

1. City hotels have 14% higher cancellation rates than resort hotels, possibly due to the fact that city hotels are mainly used for urgent work purposes, for which plans can change easily.
2. As lead time increases, the cancellation rate decreases, showing the importance of early bookings for hotels.
3. Certain months have higher cancellations than others, which highlights the importance of considering the arrival month when analyzing booking cancellations.
4. Deposit types play a crucial role in determining the cancellation rate, with bookings that have no deposit or non refundable deposits having a higher likelihood of getting canceled.
5. We also found that certain customer types show different patterns in booking cancellation, emphasizing the importance of understanding customer behavior when analyzing booking cancellations.

Overall, this project highlights the importance of predictive analytics in the hotel industry, and how it can be used to improve key metrics such as booking cancellations. With the increasing emphasis on data-driven decision making, this project provides valuable insights for hotel businesses looking to stay competitive in the industry.
